        # A real segmentation head is more complex, involving upsampling and multiple conv layers.
        # It would typically take features from multiple neck levels.

        # To use actual ultralytics neck/head:
        # 1. Get a config file (e.g., yolov8n-seg.yaml).
        # 2. Modify the config so that the neck part expects [C, C, C] as input channels from the backbone.
        #    This involves changing `ch` values in the neck's definition in the yaml.
        #    For example, if backbone outputs in yaml are `[128, 256, 512]`, and our C=256,
        #    we'd change them to `[256, 256, 256]`.
        # 3. Instantiate `SegmentationModel(cfg=modified_yaml_path, ch=backbone_in_channels, nc=num_classes)`.
        # 4. `self.yolo_model_full = SegmentationModel(...)`
        # 5. In forward: `return self.yolo_model_full.neck(fused_features_list) + self.yolo_model_full.head(...)`
        #    This requires `yolo_model_full` to expose `neck` and `head` as callable modules or similar.
        #    More typically, `SegmentationModel.model` is a `nn.Sequential` or `nn.ModuleList`.
        #    `self.seg_model = SegmentationModel(cfg=modified_yolo_cfg_path, ch=C, nc=num_classes)`
        #    Then in forward: `x = self.seg_model.model[1:]([fused_p3, fused_p4, fused_p5])` (neck+head)
        #    This assumes model[0] is backbone, model[1:] is neck and head.
        
        # For the purpose of this task, we'll keep placeholders for neck/head for now
        # and focus on the dual backbone and fusion.
        # We will assume the neck and head can be adapted from a YOLOv11 segmentation model.
        # The `ultralytics.nn.tasks.SegmentationModel` class builds the network from a YAML config.
        # It has a `_predict_once` method that does the full pass.
        # For this exercise, we'll simulate the neck and head part.
        # A proper YOLO neck (like PAN) takes multiple feature maps and processes them.
        # E.g., neck([fp3, fp4, fp5]) -> [np3, np4, np5]
        # Then head(np3, np4, np5) -> seg_masks
        # The SegmentationModel's `predict` method (called by `forward`) handles this.
        # Let's use a full SegmentationModel but we will effectively "ignore" its backbone part
        # and feed our fused features into where its neck would expect them.
        # This is tricky because the connections are hardcoded by the YAML.
        
        # Let's use a placeholder for the YOLOv11 neck and head for now.
        # These would be replaced by actual modules from ultralytics,
        # potentially requiring a custom YAML config for channel compatibility.
        
        # Placeholder Neck: Assumes it takes a list of 3 feature maps [P3, P4, P5]

        # A real YOLO neck would take [fused_p3, fused_p4, fused_p5]

        # For YOLOv8-seg style head, it often involves:
        # - Neck processing (e.g., PANet) producing [N3, N4, N5]
        # - Detection head operating on N3, N4, N5 for bounding boxes & classes
        # - Segmentation head producing mask coefficients from N3, N4, N5
        # - And a prototype mask module (often from N3 or an early feature map)
        
        # Simplified: assume fused_p3 is the primary feature for segmentation output
        # after some neck processing (here, Identity).
        # This is a major simplification of YOLO neck/head.

        # Simulating YOLOv8-seg style output:
        # It needs box outputs, class outputs, and mask outputs (coefficients + prototypes)
        # For this task, only segmentation head is specified "同 YOLO11 segmentation 任务"
        
        # Let's assume the "neck" output provides features for the segmentation head.
        # And segmentation head (from ultralytics) might take multiple features from neck.
        # For now, let's assume a simplified segmentation output from the "main" feature map (e.g., P3-level)
        
        # Placeholder for segmentation output:
        # If head produces masks directly (B, num_masks, H_mask, W_mask)
        # where num_masks = num_classes for semantic segmentation.
        
        # If using ultralytics SegmentationModel structure, it outputs a list:
        # The first element is detection output (box, cls), (N, K, 4+num_classes+num_prototypes)
        # The second element is segmentation prototypes, (N, num_prototypes, H_proto, W_proto)
        
        # For this task, let's assume the goal is semantic segmentation masks directly from the head.
        # The "head: 同 YOLO11 segmentation 任务" is a bit ambiguous without specific YOLOv11 seg head details.
        # Let's assume it means producing per-pixel class scores for `num_classes`.
        
        # We'll use the simplified seg_head_placeholder for now.
        # A proper implementation would integrate an actual YOLO segmentation head,
        # which might take features from fused_p3, fused_p4, fused_p5 after neck processing.
        
        # Let's refine the placeholder for the head to be more aligned with ultralytics seg heads.
        # A common pattern is to have features from different scales from the neck,
        # and then a segmentation head that processes them.
        # For instance, the head might take the smallest feature map (e.g., from fused_p3 after neck)
        # and upsample it.
        
        # For now, this will be the output. It should be (Batch, NumClasses, H/8, W/8)
        # and would typically be upsampled to original image size for loss calculation.
        
        # To simulate something closer to ultralytics Segment head:
        # It takes multiple feature maps from the neck [P3, P4, P5] (these are fused ones here)
        # And outputs box predictions and mask coefficients from these.
        # And also prototype masks usually from an earlier layer or P3.
        
        # Our "neck_placeholder" and "seg_head_placeholder" are too simple.
        # To make it runnable, we need to define what this model returns.
        # Let's assume it returns the direct output of a segmentation Conv layer applied on P3 features.
        
        # The task "同 YOLO11 segmentation 任务" implies we should try to mirror
        # a standard YOLO segmentation output format if possible.
        # Ultralytics YOLOv8 SegmentationModel.forward returns a list:
        # result[0]: concatenated predictions (boxes, class scores, mask coefficients)
        # result[1]: (optional) segmentation prototypes
        # The training loop would then use a loss function that decodes these.
